# To Do

* Readme
* Actions
  * Are there any useful default actions to be included here (e.g. transitionTo)?
* Examples
  * A JavaScript example including all config to build and run the project
* How can we decouple the history API events from specific model names?
* Better, stricter type declarations
* Should the API server be integrated here directly or in a separate project?
* Actions with before, around, after methods for aspect orientation and middleware (logging, authentication, data fetching, caching)
* Default solutions for authentication, access control, payments, ...

* Find good default fonts for Armenian (Հայերեն), Georgian (ქართული), Hindi (हिंदी) and (עברית) Hebrew (and many others...)

* There seems to be some issue with the TSX spread operator when trying to apply styles.
* Find uniform sample text and all possible scripts. Perhaps Article 1. of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights? (All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.) http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html
